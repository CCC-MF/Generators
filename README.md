# Scala/Java Generators


## Purpose / Background

Provide type-class-based utilities for generation of arbitrary data types
with support for automatic derivation of type class instances.

Initially a learning project largely inspired from exercises
in ["Functional Programming in Scala"](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)
and [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/)

## Status

Now mature with tests for most features


## Usage examples

See respective code part and also unit tests there
